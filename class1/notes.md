## Introduction

When we think about accessing a website, there's more happening behind the scenes than meets the eye. The URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is what we usually type into the address bar to access a web page. However, the URL represents much more than just a web address. It's a pathway to the actual resource we're trying to access on the internet.


## Process
To break it down, when we enter a URL, the full form of URL comes into play: **Uniform Resource Locator**. This term accurately describes what it does â€” it locates a specific resource on the internet. This resource could be anything from a text document to a video, and the server's job is to provide us with that resource.

A **server**, in this context, isn't a physical location but rather a program running somewhere in the world. This program generates the website content for us. It's important to note that a server is not a database. Rather, it's a responsive entity that resides somewhere in the vast expanse of the digital world. Imagine it as a helpful entity that receives your request and promptly serves you the requested information.


### Structure your code
#### Div
Div elements are often used to structure and style sections of a web page, making it easier to apply CSS styles or JavaScript functionality to specific groups of content.

#### Code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h2>Welcome to Scalar Topics</h2>
        <p>
         We're glad you're here
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
#### Output

#### Section
Sections are used to structure the content of a web page into logical parts, such as chapters, articles, or different sections of a document.

#### Code: 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <section>
        <h2>Section Title</h2>
        <p>This is a section of content.</p>
        
    </section>
</body>
</html>
```
### Tags and buttons

### Header tags

Header tags are used to structure the hierarchy of content on a webpage, with `<h1>` typically being the main title and `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and so on used for subsections. They help improve the accessibility and readability of content.
    
#### Code:

```html
<h1>Main Heading</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Sub-subheading</h3>
```

#### Output

#### Anchor tags
Anchor tags are used to link to other web pages or resources, both within the same website or externally to other websites.

#### Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <section>
        <a href = "https://www.scaler.com/topics/autoboxing-in-java/">Learn autoboxing - in - java</a>
    </section>
</body>
</html>

```
#### Output

#### Image tags
Image tags are used to display graphics, photographs, icons, or any other visual content on a webpage. The alt attribute provides alternative text for accessibility and SEO purposes.

#### Code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Basic HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
   <img src = "img.jpg" alt = "Description of the image">
</body>
</html>
```

#### Buttons
Button elements are used to create clickable elements that can trigger actions when clicked, such as submitting a form or triggering JavaScript functions.

#### Code:
```html
<button type = "button"> BUTTON </button>
```
